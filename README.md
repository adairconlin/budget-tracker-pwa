# Budget Tracker

## Description
Offline functionalities in applications are only becoming more popular. They can be especially necessary when it comes to important information such as handling a users finances. This application allows a user to track their money quickly and easily with a visual representation of the users expenses and deposits made in their budget. Not only that, but users can submit data without an internet connection and reliably expect the application to add their entries to the tracker once the application is back online.

This application began as a regular, pre-built web application from starter code you can see [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/symmetrical-bassoon). I then added a web manifest to this application as well as service workers in order to enhance this web application into becoming a full mobile-first PWA. This applicaiton uses MongoDB and is deployed on Heroku using MongoDB Atlas.
